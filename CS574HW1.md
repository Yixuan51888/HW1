# Warm up

- The first one is Newton's first law of motion: an object will stay rest or move in a constant speed in a straight line without additional force.
- The second one is Einstein's mass-energy equation: $E = M \times C^2$
- The last one is the time complexity of Quicksort on average in Big-O notation. O($n\times log(n)$).
